GlassDoor:
While o9 was conceived by founders Sanjiv Sidhu and Chakri Gottemukkala in 2009, the journey started much before. It started in the late 1980s when Sanjiv came out of the Artificial Intelligence labs of Texas Instruments and founded i2 along with Ken Sharma, a thought leader in constraint based planning. There, Sanjiv and Ken pioneered game-changing planning and supply chain management software that drove billions in value for large manufacturers and retailers across all industry segments. When the company was acquired in 2008, Sanjiv and Chakri, a key contributor in the i2 journey got together as they felt there was huge value to be delivered in making corporations more agile by helping management make faster, more intelligent decisions in the face of growing market complexity and speed. Furthermore, they saw that new advances in digital technologies make amazing things possible. And hence o9 was born, bringing some of the world’s best technologists and industry experts on the mission to create the most value generating enterprise software platform ever.
Mission: Faster, more intelligent business decision making translates directly to better financial results, but it means much more. It means organizations can achieve their goals while using less of the earth’s precious resources, drive more transparency, reduce organizational politics, empower people, and increase productivity. That translates to inspired employees. We are on a mission to develop the best technology to aid organizations in this critical pursuit.
